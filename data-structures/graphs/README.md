**GRAPH REPRESENTATIONS**

1. Adjacency Matrix:

``Operations like fetching an edge, adding and removing an edge is O(1).

``Adding a vertex is O(V2).

``Space taken ins O(V2).

2. Adjacency List:
Pros: Less space as we are only saving the existing edges in the graph instead of all the possible edges.
