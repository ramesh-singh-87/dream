1. NoSQL databases are grouped into four categories: key-value stores, graph stores, column stores, and document stores. 
2. Non-relational databases might be the right choice if:
   • Your application requires super-low latency.
   • Your data are unstructured, or you do not have any relational data.
   • You only need to serialize and deserialize data (JSON, XML, YAML, etc.).
   • You need to store a massive amount of data.
3. A private IP is an IP address reachable only
   between servers in the same network; however, it is unreachable over the internet.
